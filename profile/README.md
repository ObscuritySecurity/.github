Welcome to the official GitHub organization for **ObscuritySecurity**. We are a collective dedicated to building open-source software that empowers people to reclaim their digital freedom.

## Our Mission

Our mission is to provide powerful, intuitive, and secure tools that put control back where it belongs: in the hands of the individual. We believe that privacy is a fundamental right, not a feature, and we build our software on this unwavering foundation.

## Our Core Principles

All of our projects are guided by a strict, non-negotiable set of principles defined in **[protocol-3305](https://github.com/ObscuritySecurity/protocol-3305)**

-    1: Privacy by Design
Privacy must be integrated into the fundamental architecture of any compliant system. Each application shall be designed from the ground up to minimize data collection and maximize the protection of people

-    Security by Default
Compliant solutions must be delivered with the highest security settings enabled by default. People should not need to be experts to be protected; the protocol ensures that safety is the standard state, not an option.

-    3: Zero Trust
All systems must operate under the premise "never trust, always verify." The architecture shall not implicitly trust any actor, internal or external. Access to resources must be granted granularly and be continuously validated

-    4: Zero Knowledge
Compliant applications must be engineered so the service provider has zero knowledge of the content people create, store, or transmit. All person-generated content must be end-to-end encrypted, with decryption keys accessible only to the person, not the server.

## Our Projects

-   **[TwoAuth](https://github.com/ObscuritySecurity/TwoAuth)**: Respecting the people behind the screen. A 2FA app built on a simple, radical idea: no tracking, no ads, no data collection.


-   **[CrytoTool](https://github.com/ObscuritySecurity/CrytoTool)**: A four-in-one, end-to-end encrypted file manager, gallery, music player, and document viewer where your privacy comes first

## How to Contribute

We are an open-source project driven by the community. Whether it's through code contributions, security audits, or community moderation, your involvement is vital.
