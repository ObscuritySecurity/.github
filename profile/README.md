Welcome to the official GitHub organization for **ObscuritySecurity**. We are a collective dedicated to building open-source software that empowers people to reclaim their digital freedom.

## Our Mission

Our mission is to provide powerful, intuitive, and secure tools that put control back where it belongs: in the hands of the individual. We believe that privacy is a fundamental right, not a feature, and we build our software on this unwavering foundation.

## Our Core Principles

All of our projects are guided by a strict, non-negotiable set of principles defined in **[protocol-3305](https://github.com/ObscuritySecurity/protocol-3305)**


| **1.Privacy by Design** | **We never collect any personal data.** All of our apps are built from the ground up so that nothing that could identify you is ever gathered, stored, or processed. |
| **2.Security by Default** | **Our tools come with the strongest security settings already turned on.** You don’t need to be a security expert to stay safe – security is the default, not an optional extra. |
| **3.Zero Trust** | **We assume no one is trustworthy until proven otherwise.** Every request for a resource is carefully checked, with tiny, specific permissions that are constantly re‑checked. In short, every interaction is treated as potentially risky until it’s proven safe. |
| **4.No Servers** | **We run completely without servers.** All processing, encryption, and data storage happen on your device, so there is no central infrastructure that could be compromised or that could see your data. |

## Our Projects

-   **[TwoAuth](https://github.com/ObscuritySecurity/TwoAuth)**: Respecting the people behind the screen. A 2FA app built on a simple, radical idea: no tracking, no ads, no data collection.


-   **[CrytoTool](https://github.com/ObscuritySecurity/CrytoTool)**: A four-in-one, end-to-end encrypted file manager, gallery, music player, and document viewer where your privacy comes first
