# ObscuritySecurity

### Security by Design, Privacy as a Standard.

Welcome to the official GitHub organization for **ObscuritySecurity**. We are a collective dedicated to building open-source software that empowers people to reclaim their digital freedom.

## Our Mission

Our mission is to provide powerful, intuitive, and secure tools that put control back where it belongs: in the hands of the individual. We believe that privacy is a fundamental right, not a feature, and we build our software on this unwavering foundation.

## Our Core Principles

All of our projects are guided by a strict, non-negotiable set of principles defined in **[Protocol 3305](https://www.obscuritysecurity.com/protocol-3305)**. These include:

-   🔐 **Zero Knowledge & Zero Data Collection**: We are architecturally blind to your data. We cannot access, sell, or be forced to surrender information we do not possess.
-   🛡️ **Security by Default**: Our applications are delivered with the highest security settings enabled from the start.
-   👁️‍🗨️ **Open Source & Verifiable**: We operate on a "verify, don't trust" model. Our code is open for public audit, allowing anyone to confirm our security and privacy claims.
-   ⛓️ **No Centralized Control**: Our tools are designed to function offline and without reliance on centralized servers that can be compromised or controlled.

## Our Projects

-   **[TwoAuth](https://github.com/ObscuritySecurity/TwoAuth)**: TwoAuth is a two-factor authentication (2FA) application built on a simple and radical idea: respect for the user.


-   **[CrytoTool](https://github.com/ObscuritySecurity/CrytoTool)**: A four-in-one, end-to-end encrypted file manager, gallery, music player, and document viewer where your privacy comes first

## How to Contribute
