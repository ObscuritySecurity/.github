Welcome to the official GitHub organization for **ObscuritySecurity**. We are a collective dedicated to building open-source software that empowers people to reclaim their digital freedom.

## Our Mission

Our mission is to provide powerful, intuitive, and secure tools that put control back where it belongs: in the hands of the individual. We believe that privacy is a fundamental right, not a feature, and we build our software on this unwavering foundation.

## Our Core Principles

All of our projects are guided by a strict, non-negotiable set of principles defined in **[protocol-3305](https://github.com/ObscuritySecurity/protocol-3305)**


## 1. Privacy by Design  
**We** embed privacy directly into the foundational architecture of every system we build. Each application is conceived from the ground up to **minimise data collection** and to **maximise the protection of people**. No unnecessary personal information is ever gathered, stored, or processed beyond what is strictly required for the service to function.

## 2. Security by Default  
**We** deliver solutions with the highest security settings enabled out‑of‑the‑box. People should not need expert knowledge to stay safe; **security is the default state**, not an optional add‑on. All cryptographic primitives, key‑derivation parameters, and access controls are pre‑configured to meet strong security standards before any configuration is exposed to the public.

## 3. Zero Trust  
**We** operate under the principle “never trust, always verify.” The architecture never assumes implicit trust for any actor—whether internal or external. Access to every resource is **granted on a granular basis** and **continuously validated** through authentication, authorization checks, and attestation mechanisms. Every request is treated as potentially hostile until proven otherwise.

## 4. Zero Knowledge  
**We** engineer our applications so that the service provider possesses **zero knowledge** of the content people create, store, or transmit. All person‑generated data is **end‑to‑end encrypted**, and decryption keys reside solely in the people’s devices, never on the server. Consequently, even the operators of the service cannot read, modify, or infer any protected information.

## Our Projects

-   **[TwoAuth](https://github.com/ObscuritySecurity/TwoAuth)**: Respecting the people behind the screen. A 2FA app built on a simple, radical idea: no tracking, no ads, no data collection.


-   **[CrytoTool](https://github.com/ObscuritySecurity/CrytoTool)**: A four-in-one, end-to-end encrypted file manager, gallery, music player, and document viewer where your privacy comes first

## How to Contribute

We are an open-source project driven by the community. Whether it's through code contributions, security audits, or community moderation, your involvement is vital.
